 Identification of Collocations in Text: Application of Chi-Square and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) Measures for Bigram Collocations
 This study focuses on the identification of collocations in text, particularly bigram collocations, using two well-known measures of association: the chi-square test and the pointwise mutual information (PMI). Collocations are significant word combinations that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance. The objective is to identify meaningful word pairs in the text corpus by calculating their association scores and selecting the most relevant collocations based on these measures. The chi-square test assesses the statistical significance of the observed and expected frequencies, while the PMI score quantifies the degree of dependency between words in a bigram. This formal analysis aims to enhance our understanding of collocational patterns in natural language and provide insights into the co-occurrence tendencies of words in sentences.
 The executions time taken by collocation code to get collocation is very high so I have run the code for first 1000 words on Google Collab and for 100 words on terminal. I have checked the chi_square and PMI values for bigrams my code is running properly only problem is to optimize it to run with lesser time.
